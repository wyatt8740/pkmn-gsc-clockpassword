This software calculates a password for resetting the clock in the
Game Boy Color games Pokémon Gold and Silver. It can work with Pokémon Crystal
aswell, but it requires a GameShark.

Where to Get the Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get the player-character name, trainer ID number, and amount of held money,
enter the main menu by pressing START. Then select the option labelled with the
player character name (this should be above SAVE). The player character name,
trainer ID number, and amount of held money are at the top of the screen.

Using the Password
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Gold and Silver, at the title screen, press DOWN+SELECT+B. Select YES to
reset the clock. Enter the password at the password prompt. It resets the clock
upon receiving the correct password. Next time you select CONTINUE at the main
menu, it will ask for the day of week and the time.

In Crystal, it is not possible to reset the clock legitimately. If you are
willing and able to use a GameShark, the code is 010464CF. After entering this
GameShark code, press A at the title screen. It will then ask if you want to
reset the clock. At this point, remove the GameShark code and then proceed
normally.
